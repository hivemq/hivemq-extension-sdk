== HiveMQ Extension SDK

The enterprise MQTT broker HiveMQ offers this free and open source Extension SDK. This allows everyone to extend HiveMQ and add custom functionality via extensions.

With custom HiveMQ extensions, it's easy to add functionality like writing messages to databases, integrate with other service buses, collect statistics, add fine-grained security and virtually anything you else you can imagine.

Extension development for HiveMQ is as easy as writing a Java main method once you grasp the core concepts.

=== Using the SDK

An extensive HiveMQ extension documentation is available {hivemq-extensions-docu-link}[on the official HiveMQ website]. It covers the core concepts and shows how to set up your development environment.

You can also clone our example open source HiveMQ extension at {hivemq-github-link}[in our Github page].
